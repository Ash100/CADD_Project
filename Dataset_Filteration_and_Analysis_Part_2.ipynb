        "  In a virtual screening (molecular docking), our aim is to predict whether a compound might bind to a specific target. However, if we want to identify a new drug, it is also important that this compound reaches the target and is eventually removed from the body in a favorable way. Therefore, we should also consider whether a compound is actually taken up into the body and whether it is able to cross certain barriers in order to reach its target. Is it metabolically stable and how will it be excreted once it is not acting at the target anymore? These processes are investigated in the field of pharmacokinetics. In contrast to pharmacodynamics (“What does the drug do to our body?”), pharmacokinetics deals with the question “What happens to the drug in our body?”.\n",
        "\n",
        "**ADME** - absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion:\n",
        "Pharmacokinetics are mainly divided into four steps: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion. These are summarized as ADME. Often, ADME also includes Toxicology and is thus referred to as ADMET or ADMETox. Below, the ADME steps are discussed in more detail (Wikipedia and Mol Pharm. (2010), 7(5), 1388-1405).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Absorption:** The amount and the time of drug-uptake into the body depends on multiple factors which can vary between individuals and their conditions as well as on the properties of the substance. Factors such as (poor) compound solubility, gastric emptying time, intestinal transit time, chemical (in-)stability in the stomach, and (in-)ability to permeate the intestinal wall can all influence the extent to which a drug is absorbed after e.g. oral administration, inhalation, or contact to skin.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Distribution:** The distribution of an absorbed substance, i.e. within the body, between blood and different tissues, and crossing the blood-brain barrier are affected by regional blood flow rates, molecular size and polarity of the compound, and binding to serum proteins and transporter enzymes. Critical effects in toxicology can be the accumulation of highly apolar substances in fatty tissue, or crossing of the blood-brain barrier.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Metabolism:** After entering the body, the compound will be metabolized. This means that only part of this compound will actually reach its target. Mainly liver and kidney enzymes are responsible for the break-down of xenobiotics (substances that are extrinsic to the body).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Excretion:** Compounds and their metabolites need to be removed from the body via excretion, usually through the kidneys (urine) or in the feces. Incomplete excretion can result in accumulation of foreign substances or adverse interference with normal metabolism.\n"
